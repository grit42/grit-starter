# grit starter

This repo can be used to run the grit Scientific Data Management System locally or on a remote server.

## Requirements

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Before continuing, ensure the Docker daemon is running.

### Server requirements

grit has been shown to run smoothly on modest hardware such as [Hetzner CPX21](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) with over 200 millions data points.

Indicative requirements for less than 10 concurrent users:
- 2 vCPUs @ 3 GHz
- 4 GB RAM
- 40 GB storage

## Running the app

### Get the environment

1. Clone this repo or download and extract the [zip](https://github.com/grit42/grit-starter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Copy the content of `.env.template` to `.env`
    * Some users may need to enable display of hidden files if using a file explorer

Subsequent steps of this guide are to be executed in the cloned repository or the extracted zip unless instructed otherwise.

### Start the database and app services

Run the following command in a terminal to start the application:

```sh
docker compose up
```

### Activate the admin user

The `admin` user must be activated to start using the application the first time it is started.

Navigate to `/app/core/activate/admin` (e.g. when running locally http://localhost:3000/app/core/activate/admin) to activate the `admin` user by configuring its password.

## Mail service configuration

User management, password recovery and two-factor authentication require an SMTP mail service.

The SMTP mail service can be configured through environment variables in the `.env` file.

The following variables are required:
```sh
# Mailer configuration
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_TOKEN=SMTP_TOKEN
SMTP_USER=user@example.com

# The URL at which grit is running
# used to build activation and password reset URLs
GRIT_SERVER_URL=https://grit.example.com
```

## Maintaining the app

### Backup the database

It is a good idea to back up the database regularly and before upgrading.
If a backup already exists, it will be overwritten when making a new backup.

Run the following command to back up the database:
```sh
docker compose run --rm backup
```

### Restore the latest backup

Run the following command to restore the latest backup of the database:
```sh
docker compose run --rm restore
```

### Upgrading to a new version

New releases are announced in [Discussions](https://github.com/grit42/grit/discussions/categories/announcements) of the main repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/grit42/grit). Additional steps or warnings may be specified in the release announcement, please read it carefully before upgrading.

Run the following command to upgrade to the latest version:
```sh
docker compose pull app
docker compose up --no-deps --force-recreate app
```

## Upgrading from previous sample docker compose

1.  Ensure the values in the `.env` file match the environment in the compose file used to run the app before
2.  In the directory containing the new `docker-compose.yml` file, start the new `db` service to create the volume
    ```sh
    docker compose up -d db
    ```
3.  In the directory containing the previous `docker-compose.yml` file, copy database files into the volume using a helper container, for example on a Unix system:
    ```sh
    docker run --rm \
        -v ./postgres-data:/from \
        -v grit_postgres_data:/to \
        alpine \
        sh -c "cd /from && tar cf - . | tar xf - -C /to"
    ```
4. Fix database files ownership
    ```sh
    docker run --rm \
      -v grit_postgres_data:/data \
      alpine \
      chown -R 999:999 /data
    ```
